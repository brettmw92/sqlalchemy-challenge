Tables containing weather data from different measurement stations were reflected into SQL object relationship mapper. 
I plotted one year's worth of precipitation data from one of the most active measurement stations.
I determined how many stations were active in the database and identified the station with the most measurements over the past year.
For the bonus, I used a defined function to return the minimum T, average T, and maximum T over a given date range.
As an example, I evaluated a trip to Hawaii over the dates 11-15 to 11-28 to see the temperature values recorded during that time frame in 2016 by the calc_temps function.
